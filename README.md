Commits
---
To use the commit template defined in `.gitmessage`, simply open this repository and run:

```shell
git config commit.template ./.gitmessage
```

Commits descriptions should be prefixed with one or more [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/), and be less than 72 characters long. In addition, commit messages should be well-written and use [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests) where appropriate, or be left blank.

Issues
---
To use issue templates, simply open an issue, and choose the appropriate template.

Pull Requests
---
To use PR templates, you must append the `&template=` query parameter when opening a PR, as described [in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request).
